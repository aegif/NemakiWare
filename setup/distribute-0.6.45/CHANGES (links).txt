CHANGES
=======

------
0.6.45
------

* `Issue #379`_: ``distribute_setup.py`` now traps VersionConflict as well,
  restoring ability to upgrade from an older setuptools version.

------
0.6.44
------

* ``distribute_setup.py`` has been updated to allow Setuptools 0.7 to
  satisfy use_setuptools.

------
0.6.43
------

* Issue #378: Restore support for Python 2.4 Syntax (regression in 0.6.42).

------
0.6.42
------

* External links finder no longer yields duplicate links.
* Issue #337: Moved site.py to setuptools/site-patch.py (graft of very old
  patch from setuptools trunk which inspired PR #31).

------
0.6.41
------

* Issue #27: Use public api for loading resources from zip files rather than
  the private method `_zip_directory_cache`.
* Added a new function ``easy_install.get_win_launcher`` which may be used by
  third-party libraries such as buildout to get a suitable script launcher.

------
0.6.40
------

* Issue #376: brought back cli.exe and gui.exe that were deleted in the
  previous release.

------
0.6.39
------

* Add support for console launchers on ARM platforms.
* Fix possible issue in GUI launchers where the subsystem was not supplied to
  the linker.
* Launcher build script now refactored for robustness.
* Issue #375: Resources extracted from a zip egg to the file system now also
  check the contents of the file against the zip contents during each
  invocation of get_resource_filename.

------
0.6.38
------

* Issue #371: The launcher manifest file is now installed properly.

------
0.6.37
------

* Issue #143: Launcher scripts, including easy_install itself, are now
  accompanied by a manifest on 32-bit Windows environments to avoid the
  Installer Detection Technology and thus undesirable UAC elevation described
  in `this Microsoft article
  <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709628%28WS.10%29.aspx>`_.

------
0.6.36
------

* Pull Request #35: In `Buildout issue 64
  <https://github.com/buildout/buildout/issues/64>`_, it was reported that
  under Python 3, installation of distutils scripts could attempt to copy
  the ``__pycache__`` directory as a file, causing an error, apparently only
  under Windows. Easy_install now skips all directories when processing
  metadata scripts.

------
0.6.35
------


Note this release is backward-incompatible with distribute 0.6.23-0.6.34 in
how it parses version numbers.

* Issue #278: Restored compatibility with distribute 0.6.22 and setuptools
  0.6. Updated the documentation to match more closely with the version
  parsing as intended in setuptools 0.6.

------
0.6.34
------

* Issue #341: 0.6.33 fails to build under Python 2.4.

------
0.6.33
------

* Fix 2 errors with Jython 2.5.
* Fix 1 failure with Jython 2.5 and 2.7.
* Disable workaround for Jython scripts on Linux systems.
* Issue #336: `setup.py` no longer masks failure exit code when tests fail.
* Fix issue in pkg_resources where try/except around a platform-dependent
  import would trigger hook load failures on Mercurial. See pull request 32
  for details.
* Issue #341: Fix a ResourceWarning.

------
0.6.32
------

* Fix test suite with Python 2.6.
* Fix some DeprecationWarnings and ResourceWarnings.
* Issue #335: Backed out `setup_requires` superceding installed requirements
  until regression can be addressed.

------
0.6.31
------

* Issue #303: Make sure the manifest only ever contains UTF-8 in Python 3.
* Issue #329: Properly close files created by tests for compatibility with
  Jython.
* Work around Jython bugs `#1980 <http://bugs.jython.org/issue1980>`_ and
  `#1981 <http://bugs.jython.org/issue1981>`_.
* `Issue #334`_: Provide workaround for packages that reference `sys.__stdout__`
  such as numpy does. This change should address
  `virtualenv #359 <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/359>`_ as long
  as the system encoding is UTF-8 or the IO encoding is specified in the
  environment, i.e.::

     PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 pip install numpy

* Fix for encoding issue when installing from Windows executable on Python 3.
* `Issue #323`_: Allow `setup_requires` requirements to supercede installed
  requirements. Added some new keyword arguments to existing pkg_resources
  methods. Also had to updated how __path__ is handled for namespace packages
  to ensure that when a new egg distribution containing a namespace package is
  placed on sys.path, the entries in __path__ are found in the same order they
  would have been in had that egg been on the path when pkg_resources was
  first imported.

------
0.6.30
------

* `Issue #328`_: Clean up temporary directories in distribute_setup.py.
* Fix fatal bug in distribute_setup.py.

------
0.6.29
------

* Pull Request #14: Honor file permissions in zip files.
* `Issue #327`_: Merged pull request #24 to fix a dependency problem with pip.
* Merged pull request #23 to fix https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/301.
* If Sphinx is installed, the `upload_docs` command now runs `build_sphinx`
  to produce uploadable documentation.
* `Issue #326`_: `upload_docs` provided mangled auth credentials under Python 3.
* `Issue #320`_: Fix check for "createable" in distribute_setup.py.
* `Issue #305`_: Remove a warning that was triggered during normal operations.
* `Issue #311`_: Print metadata in UTF-8 independent of platform.

* `Issue #299`_: The develop command didn't work on Python 3, when using 2to3,
  as the egg link would go to the Python 2 source. Linking to the 2to3'd code
  in build/lib makes it work, although you will have to rebuild the module
  before testing it.
* `Issue #306`_: Even if 2to3 is used, we build in-place under Python 2.
* `Issue #307`_: Prints the full path when .svn/entries is broken.
* `Issue #313`_: Support for sdist subcommands (Python 2.7)
* `Issue #314`_: test_local_index() would fail an OS X.
* `Issue #310`_: Non-ascii characters in a namespace __init__.py causes errors.

  `include_package_data`. Files indicated by `package_data` are now included
  in the manifest.
* `distribute_setup.py` now allows a `--download-base` argument for retrieving
  distribute from a specified location.

------
0.6.28
------

* Reviewed unladen-swallow specific change from
  http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/source/detail?spec=svn875&r=719
  and determined that it no longer applies. Distribute should work fine with
  Unladen Swallow 2009Q3.
